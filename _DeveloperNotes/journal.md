We will soon need to determine how to do continuous deployment without clobbering the database each time.

It might be worth removing the bootstrap classes from the HTML and instead using SASS overrides.

It might be worth introducing a <nav-item> tag helper. That would lead to more consise *.cshtml pages.

We could improve the web document citation and reference list to include the sub-section of the work.

A good goal would be to add five forms to /Tools and then to start optimizing/refactoring.

Shorter URLs to the tools would be nice. E.g. socialarts.club/as for the assertiveness scorecard

Listing all the tools on the home/landing page would be nice.

Setting the focus to each form's first input would be nice.
